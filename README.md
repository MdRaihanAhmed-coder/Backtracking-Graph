# Backtracking-Graph
The graph was created analyzing the linux events using sysdig 

## Objective
In an operating system, a process can read or write into a file. Again, a socket can create a process. So, there is a connection between these 3 things. In this project, I have created backtracking graph which shows the connection in between those 3 with a simple example. 
 - I have downloaded a project from github
 - The project is downloaded using wget, which is connecting with the socket
 - Then that is unzipped using tar. That is reading from the zip file and writing into the Web-Development-Project-master file
 
 
 **Using this backtracking graph, we can extract the hindered files during an attack in an industry floor.**
